# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya Raj Singh

🚀 Cloud & DevOps Enthusiast | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner  
🎓 MCA Graduate | Hands-on with AWS, Linux, EC2, ALB & Auto Scaling  

I enjoy building cloud infrastructure **by doing**, not just reading docs.  
My focus is on understanding *how systems work together* — from a single EC2 instance to scalable, highly available architectures.

- Building **EC2 → ALB → Auto Scaling Group** architectures
- Practicing **self-healing, load balancing, and AMI-based deployments**
- Learning **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** step by step
- Documenting real cloud problems & fixes for learning and sharing
